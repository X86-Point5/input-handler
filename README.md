## Overview

`InputHandler.py` is a Python module that provides a collection of functions designed to safely and robustly handle various types of console input from users. It simplifies the process of prompting users for input and validating that input against specified criteria, such as data type, bounds, and allowed characters.

The primary purpose of this module is to be included in other Python projects via an `import` statement, allowing developers to easily call its functions whenever they need to securely gather information from the user via the console.
